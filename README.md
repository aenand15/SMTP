# SMTP
SMTP Client and Server in Python
By running both programs on linux a user can interact with the client to develop an email message and an image if they wish. 
The program is a state machine to ensure it processes through the cycle properly and displays any warning sign when a user does not input something properly or if the socket breaks. It also uses a top-down parsing scheme to analyze the packet when the server receives it from the client.
